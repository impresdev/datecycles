# Datecycles

`Datecycles` is a Python package designed for generating a series of dates based on specific cycle periods. It's particularly useful for scheduling events on a weekly, fortnightly, 4-weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.

## Installation

Install `Datecycles` using pip:

```bash
pip install datecycles
```

## Features

- Generate dates based on different cycles: weekly, fortnightly, 4-weekly, monthly, and quarterly.
- Command-line interface for easy use in various environments.
- Robust error handling for invalid dates and input formats.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

Use `Datecycles` from the command line as follows:

```bash
datecycles <start_date> <cycle_period> <cycle_count>
```

- `start_date`: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- `cycle_period`: Cycle period, one of 52 (weekly), 26 (fortnightly), 13 (4-weekly), 12 (monthly), or 4 (quarterly).
- `cycle_count`: Number of cycles to generate.

#### Example

```bash
datecycles 2023-01-01 12 5
```

This command generates five monthly dates starting from January 1, 2023.
